This was a group project in the Winter Semester of 2019 for a Distributed Systems Course and UM Dearborn.  Our group developed a lightweight collaborative text editor modeled on EtherPad.  It allows users to create an account, create notes, share notes, and edit them in real time alongside other users.   A video demonstrating the functionality of the project is available at the following link.
